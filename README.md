# Snake

This is my introduction project into javascript, node.js, and express app development. It features the classic game of Snake with user authentication that allows players to keep their high scores accross sessions using MongoDB. You can find this app hosted on Heroku at: https://snake-expressapp.herokuapp.com/ . Heroku puts websites to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity, so you may have to wait 10 seconds or so before the page renders.

## How to use?

You must have node.js installed to run this application locally. After cloning the repo, run 
```bash
npm run start
```
in the terminal to start the application or
```bash
npm run dev
```
to enter development mode. From there, you can access the web interface at http://localhost:5000/ .

This application was inspired by the article _Simple Snake game in HTML and JavaScript_ which can be found at https://medium.com/@anMagpie/simple-snake-game-in-html-and-javascript-ed78cffac36.
