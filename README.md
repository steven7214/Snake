# Snake

This is my introduction project into javascript, node.js, and express app development. It features the classic game of Snake with user authentication that allows players to keep their high scores accross sessions using MongoDB. You can find this app hosted on Heroku at: https://snake-expressapp.herokuapp.com/ .

## How to use?

You must have node.js installed to run this application locally. After cloning the repo, run 
```bash
npm run start
```
in the terminal to start the application or
```bash
